  Hello,

  Thank you for your submission of the picture titled "{{ pending.filename }}".

  It is against the policy of The Lion King WWW Archive to accept any
fan-artwork that is not related to the film "The Lion King", and so
unfortunately it is not possible to accept your submission for inclusion
into the Fan-Art Archive.

  Please feel free to review the uploading guidelines at

that meets these guidelines. Thank you for understanding!
