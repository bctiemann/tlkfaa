<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission of the picture titled "{{ pending.filename }}".</p>

<p>
It is against the policy of The Lion King WWW Archive to accept any
fan-artwork that is not related to the film "The Lion King", and so
unfortunately it is not possible to accept your submission for inclusion
into the Fan-Art Archive.

<p>
Please feel free to review the uploading guidelines at
http://fanart.lionking.org/, and I encourage you to contribute any fan-art
that meets these guidelines. Thank you for understanding!
