it would also be kind of nice to have some site functionality options? like the picture previews when you hover
over a picture really gets in the way for me and it would be nice having an option to disable that. i also kind
of miss having it where when you click on a picture it would load it in a different window or tab or something.
when youre looking through a whole list of new submissions to look at its kind of unproductive to have to load
a page, go back, and load another. maybe its just that doing this or right clicking and opening in a new tab
for every picture bugs me, but an option or 2 would be nice.

theres also a bug ive encountered in the watched and unviewed tab where it doesnt show you all the pictures
when you consecutively click the more tab as you go through them. and example would be like if i had 20 new
submissions and i got through the 1st 10, and when i would click "more" it would say "no results" and i
would have to refresh to see the other ten. i dont think the "newest by favorite artists" tab has this
problem, and when you click on a picture and it takes you to that page when you click back you dont lose
your spot from where you were looking at pictures from, so i wouldnt think that the "watched and unviewed"
tab would be needed at all if there were just some way to differentiate pictures that you have and havent
viewed while in the "newest by favorite artists" tab (like a different colored post background r something).

+
also in the unread comments sections it also shows your own comments in there when youve replied to someone,
which i think is pretty unnecessary and honestly gets my hopes up that someone else had commented :^(

+
theres another issue in the artmanager that when youre uploading multiple pictures in a row on the page
after you uploaded the first picture and it shows you a new upload prompt, it only gives you the option
to post in your main folder.


Hi Brian, it's been a while since I was properly on the archive and everything changed so much! I was
wondering where do excepted icons go? I couldn't see any of them on my "art wall" so I was wondering if
they go somewhere different now. Thank you in advance!
